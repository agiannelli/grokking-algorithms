# Grokking Algorithms

As I go through the various concepts in [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms) I will be adding any scripts I write here.

## Why Python?

I had to use Python very early in my career but did not enjoy it. _"I'm a .NET developer!!"_ I told myself. I was young and stubborn.

The book uses Python for the example questions so I felt this would be a good opportunity to (re)learn something.

## Future

Potentially write blog posts regarding the content.  (If this interests you - reach out to me!)

My next plan is to go through [Bite-Size Python](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Bite+Size+Python%3A+An+Introduction+to+Python+Programming-p-9781119643814#:~:text=Bite-Size Python is ideal for those who are,and install Python%3B Presents key programming language concepts) by [April Speight (@vogueandcode)](https://twitter.com/vogueandcode)
